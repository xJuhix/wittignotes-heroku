                If I had to put a price tag on the insights I have
                gained from books I don't think I could. Books offer a
                tremendous amount of value and in my opinion are the
                best investment one can make. Its very hard to sit
                down with people like Benjamin Graham, Malcom
                Gladwell, Hans Rosling or all the other great thinkers
                of our time but we can always read their books. In
                this category I will share my latest reads but also
                the books that currently are in my book bag.
